# Notes:
# - Create a repository secret named `ACTIONS_DEPLOY_TOKEN` (fine-grained or classic PAT) with permission to create Releases and upload assets (repo:packages or Releases write access).
# - This workflow runs when you push a tag that starts with `v` (for example: `v1.2.3`).
# - The workflow builds on Windows (recommended for creating NSIS installers). If you want Linux/macOS builds, add additional jobs and appropriate runners.
